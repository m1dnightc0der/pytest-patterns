# pytest-patterns

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smarie/pytest-patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smarie/pytest-patterns) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://smarie.github.io/pytest-patterns/)

A couple of examples showing how to use core `pytest` mechanisms and existing plugins (no additional hooks nor hacks) to solve real-world problems.

`pytest` is great but it is extremely generic: thanks to its core `fixture` and `parametrize` concepts, the possibilities are almost infinite! The purpose of this project is to provide examples of a few of these possibilities, so that you do not need to spend hours designing your tests when your needs fall into "classical needs". 

## Current list of examples

The following examples are provided:

 * [Data science benchmark](./examples/data_science_benchmark/) demonstrates how pytest can be used as a benchmarking engine to compare the performances of several data sciences algorithms on several datasets and produce various reports (plots, csv table...).
 
Note: you can download all examples at once from [this link](https://github.com/smarie/pytest-patterns/releases/latest)
